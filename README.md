# Exclusion Label Manager for Plex

This script adds or removes Exclusion Labels on your Plex users level.

**Example use case:**</br>
Say you want to create collections you only want visible to specific user(s), you can give the collection a label and then add that label to every other user's "Exclude Labels".
If you have many users, this could be quite the chore. This script does it for you in a jiffy.

## üçø Use Cases
**1:**
- You could use [Movie Recommendations for Plex](https://github.com/netplexflix/Movie-Recommendations-for-Plex) to create a "What Should I Watch?" collection for each of your users, or groups of users, with recommendations tailored to their taste.
- If you want each collection to only be visible to the relevant user(s) you can give the collection itself a label.
- Now you can use this script to exclude every other user from seeing this collection.

**2:**
- [Create a collection with each user's Requests, only visible to them](https://www.reddit.com/r/PleX/comments/12g1aoe/howto_create_a_collection_of_your_users_request)
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you give collections a unique label and NOT the label you use to label the Movies or TV shows themselves!</br>
> Otherwise all Movies and/or TV Shows with that label will be hidden from your users as well. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Unfortunately collections pinned to Home are visible to ALL users, regardless of these exclusion labels.
> This has been a bug (or feature..?) in Plex for a long time.
> Until/Unless Plex fixes this, your users will have to go to the collections tab to find their exclusive collection.
